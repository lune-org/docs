# FS

Built-in library for filesystem access

#### Example usage

```lua
local fs = require("@lune/fs")

-- Reading a file
local myTextFile: string = fs.readFile("myFileName.txt")

-- Reading entries (files & dirs) in a directory
for _, entryName in fs.readDir("myDirName") do
	if fs.isFile("myDirName/" .. entryName) then
		print("Found file " .. entryName)
	elseif fs.isDir("myDirName/" .. entryName) then
		print("Found subdirectory " .. entryName)
	end
end
```

---

### isDir

Checks if a given path is a directory.

-   If the path is a directory or not

---

### move

Moves a file or directory to a new path.

Throws an error if a file or directory already exists at the target path. This can be bypassed by
passing `true` as the third argument, or a dictionary of options. Refer to the documentation for
`WriteOptions` for specific option keys and their values.

An error will be thrown in the following situations:

-   The current process lacks permissions to read at `from` or write at `to`.
-   The new path exists on a different mount point.
-   Some other I/O error occurred.

#### Parameters

-   `from` The path to move from

-   `to` The path to move to

-   `overwriteOrOptions` Options for the target path, such as if should be overwritten if it already
    exists

---

### copy

Copies a file or directory recursively to a new path.

Throws an error if a file or directory already exists at the target path. This can be bypassed by
passing `true` as the third argument, or a dictionary of options. Refer to the documentation for
`WriteOptions` for specific option keys and their values.

An error will be thrown in the following situations:

-   The current process lacks permissions to read at `from` or write at `to`.
-   Some other I/O error occurred.

#### Parameters

-   `from` The path to copy from

-   `to` The path to copy to

-   `overwriteOrOptions` Options for the target path, such as if should be overwritten if it already
    exists

## Types

### MetadataPermissions

Permissions for the given file or directory.

This is a dictionary that will contain the following values:

-   `readOnly` - If the target path is read-only or not

---

### Metadata

Metadata for the given file or directory.

This is a dictionary that will contain the following values:

-   `kind` - If the target path is a `file`, `dir` or `symlink`
-   `exists` - If the target path exists
-   `createdAt` - The timestamp represented as a `DateTime` object at which the file or directory
    was created
-   `modifiedAt` - The timestamp represented as a `DateTime` object at which the file or directory
    was last modified
-   `accessedAt` - The timestamp represented as a `DateTime` object at which the file or directory
    was last accessed
-   `permissions` - Current permissions for the file or directory

Note that timestamps are relative to the unix epoch, and may not be accurate if the system clock is
not accurate.

---

### WriteOptions

Options for filesystem APIs what write to files and/or directories.

This is a dictionary that may contain one or more of the following values:

-   `overwrite` - If the target path should be overwritten or not, in the case that it already
    exists
