# Modules

At this point you know how the most important built-in libraries in Lune work and how to use them,
and your code is probably getting longer and more difficult to read. Splitting your code into
multiple files can help you stay organized.

Modularizing your code and splitting it across several files in Lune is different from other
versions of Lua and Luau, and more similar to how things work in other languages such as JavaScript.

## Example File Tree

Let's use this directory & file tree structure for our examples:

<FileTree>
	<FileTree.Folder name="-" defaultOpen>
		<FileTree.File name="main.luau" />
		<FileTree.File name="sibling.luau" />
		<FileTree.Folder name="modules" defaultOpen>
			<FileTree.File name="init.luau" />
			<FileTree.File name="module.luau" />
		</FileTree.Folder>
	</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

<Tabs items={['main', 'sibling', 'modules/init', 'modules/module']}>
	<Tab>
	```luau copy filename="main.luau"
	local sibling = require("sibling")
	local modules = require("modules")

    print(sibling.Hello) --> World

    print(modules.Module.Foo) --> Bar
    print(modules.Module.Fizz) --> Buzz

    print(modules.Sibling.Hello) --> World
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
    ```luau copy filename="sibling.luau"
    return {
    	Hello = "World",
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
    ```luau copy filename="modules/init.luau"
    return {
    	Module = require("module"),
    	Sibling = require("../sibling"),
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
    ```luau copy filename="modules/module.luau"
    return {
    	Foo = "Bar",
    	Fizz = "Buzz",
    }
    ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## File Require Statements

Let's decipher these files and what they are doing:

- The `main` script requires `sibling` and `modules` next to it
- The `modules/init` script requires `module` next to it, and `sibling` going up one directory
  using `../`

In the above `require` statements, we can see that are relative to the file that they are in, and in
Lune this is always the case, except for built-in libraries, which always start with an at sign
(`@`).

<Callout type="info" emoji="❔">
	**Q:** Wait, hold on... The `main` script requires the _**directory**_
	called `modules`? <br />
	**A:** Yep, that's right. The file name `init` is special, and putting a
	file named `init.luau` in a directory will let you use `require` directly on
	the directory. Similar to `index.js` in JavaScript or `mod.rs` in Rust.
