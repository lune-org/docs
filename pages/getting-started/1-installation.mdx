# Installation

The preferred way of installing Lune is using [Aftman](https://github.com/lpghatguy/aftman).

Install Aftman, and run this command in your terminal to add `lune` to an `aftman.toml` file in the
current directory, or create one if it does not exist:

```sh copy filename="Bash"
aftman add filiptibell/lune
```

## Other Installation Options

<details>
<summary>Using GitHub Releases</summary>

You can download pre-built binaries for most systems directly from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune/releases) page. <br /> There are many tools
that can install binaries directly from releases, and it is up to you to choose what tool to use
when installing here.

### AUR (Arch User Repository)
There are a number of packages available on the AUR:

- `lune` - Builds from the latest stable release source. 
- `lune-git` - Builds from the latest commit in the repo; unstable.
- `lune-bin` - Installs a precompiled binary from GitHub Release artifacts.

These can be installed with your favourite AUR manager as such:

```sh copy filename="Bash"
paru -S [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

***or***

```sh copy filename="Bash"
yay -S [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

[Rust & Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to be installed on
