# Installation

The preferred way of installing Lune is using [Aftman](https://github.com/lpghatguy/aftman).

Install Aftman, and run this command in your terminal to add `lune` to an `aftman.toml` file in the
current directory, or create one if it does not exist:

```sh copy filename="Bash"
aftman add filiptibell/lune
```
