# Network Requests

One of Lune's most useful libraries is the networking library, also known as `net`. This library
lets you access the internet and make HTTP requests to different websites, servers, and external
APIs.

## Sending HTTP Requests

Sending HTTP requests is the most basic function of the [`net`](../../api-reference/net.md) library.
Let's make a script called `googler.luau`:

```lua copy filename="googler.luau"
local net = require("@lune/net")

local response = net.request("https://google.com")

if response.ok then
	print(
		"Google responded with status code",
		response.statusCode,
		"and response message",
		response.statusMessage,
		"!"
	)
else
	print("Google is down!! What?!?")
end
```

Now you can place this script in your current directory, and run it using Lune:

```sh copy filename="Bash"
lune googler
```

## Sending JSON Requests

[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), or JavaScript Object Notation, is the most common format
for sending data over the network. Lune includes APIs for serializing & deserializing JSON, also
known as stringifying & parsing, in the `net` library. Let's use the free testing web API at
[`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and send + receive
some JSON data:

```lua copy filename="json-api.luau"
print("Sending PATCH request to web API")

local apiResponse = net.request({
	url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1",
	method = "PATCH",
	headers = {
		["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
	},
	body = net.jsonEncode({
		title = "foo",
		body = "bar",
	}),
})

if not apiResponse.ok then
	error(
		string.format(
			"%s\n%d (%s)\n%s",
			"Failed to send network request!",
			apiResponse.statusCode,
			apiResponse.statusMessage,
			apiResponse.body
		)
	)
end

type ResponseType = {
	id: number,
	title: string,
	body: string,
	userId: number,
}

local responseTable: ResponseType = net.jsonDecode(apiResponse.body)
assert(responseTable.title == "foo", "Invalid json response")
assert(responseTable.body == "bar", "Invalid json response")

print("Got valid JSON response with post title set to 'foo' and post body set to 'bar'")
print("Full response:", responseTable)
```

Running the above script Lune should now send a request to the placeholder API, verify that the
response was correct, and print it out:

```sh copy filename="Bash"
lune json-api
```

## Network Server

Lune can not only perform network requests, it can also open a server on a given port and serve
requests on it. Here's a small example:

```lua copy filename="network-server.luau"
local net = require("@lune/net")

local counter = 0
net.serve(8080, function()
	counter += 1
	return {
		status = 200,
		body = "Hello! This is response #" .. tostring(counter),
	}
end)

print("Listening on port 8080 🚀")
```

Just like before, you can place this script in your current directory, and run it using Lune:

```sh copy filename="Bash"
lune network-server
```

Now, when you visit [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/) you should see the response
text above and the counter increasing each time you visit the page.
