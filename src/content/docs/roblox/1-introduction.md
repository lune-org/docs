title: "The Roblox Library"

Lune has a powerful built-in library and set of APIs for manipulating Roblox place files and model
files. It contains APIs for reading & writing files, and gives you instances to use, just as if you
were scripting inside of the Roblox engine, albeit with a more limited API.

- For examples on how to write Roblox-specific Lune scripts, check out the
  [Examples](./2-examples.md) page.
- For a guide on how to migrate to Lune from [Remodel](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel), check
  out the [Migrating from Remodel](./3-remodel-migration.mdx) page.
- For a full list of the currently implemented Roblox APIs, check out the
  [API Status](./4-api-status.md) page.
