Lune has a powerful standard library and set of APIs for manipulating Roblox place files and model
files. It contains APIs for reading & writing files, and gives you instances to use, just as if you
were scripting inside of the Roblox engine, albeit with a more limited API.

- For examples on how to write Roblox-specific Lune scripts, check out the [Examples](/docs/roblox/2-examples) page.
- For a guide on how to migrate to Lune from [Remodel](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel), check out the [Migrating from Remodel](/docs/roblox/3-remodel-migration) page.
