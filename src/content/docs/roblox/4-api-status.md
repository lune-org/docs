title: API Status
---

This is a page indicating the current implementation status for instance methods and datatypes in
the `roblox` library.

If an API on a class is not listed here it may not be within the scope for Lune and may not be
implemented in the future. <br /> However, if a recently added datatype is missing, and it can be
used as an instance property, it is likely that it will be implemented.

## Classes
