title: Working with Files

The `fs` library lets you work with files and directories in Lune.
You can read, write, copy, and move files around with no extra boilerplate.

## Example File Tree

Let's use this directory and file structure for our examples:

<FileTree>

- files.luau
- dirs.luau
- hello-world.json
- files
  - coolstuff.toml
  - super.secret.txt

</FileTree>

<details>
<summary>Show file contents</summary>

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="hello-world.json">
	```json
	{
		"Hello": "World"
	}
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="coolstuff.toml">
	```toml
	[you]
	cool = true
	awesome = "yep"
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="super.secret.txt">
	```txt
	Hey, you're not supposed to be in here!
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

</details>

## Files

Reading and writing files using the `fs` library is simple and only works with strings:

```luau
// files.luau
local fs = require("@lune/fs")

-- Print out the contents of all of the files
print(fs.readFile("hello-world.json"))
print(fs.readFile("files/coolstuff.toml"))
print(fs.readFile("files/super.secret.txt"))

-- Create a new file in our "files" directory
fs.writeFile("files/My Favorite Numbers.txt", "2 4 6 8 0")

-- Write to one of our files, overwriting any previous contents
fs.writeFile("files/super.secret.txt", "Super secret message")

-- Remove the new file we created in our "files" directory
fs.removeFile("files/My Favorite Numbers.txt")
```

Note that the filesystem library works with raw strings for file contents and doesn't differentiate between binary, UTF-8, or other encodings. It's up to you to know how your files are structured and handle them appropriately.

## Directories

Reading and creating directories has a similar API, but with slightly different parameters and return values:

```luau
// dirs.luau
local fs = require("@lune/fs")

-- Print out the entries found in our directory
-- The "." here means the current directory
print("Contents of current directory:")
for _, entry in fs.readDir(".") do
	if fs.isDir(entry) then
		print(`üìÅ {entry}`)
	elseif fs.isFile(entry) then
		print(`üìÑ {entry}`)
	end
end

-- Create a new directory next to the above entries
fs.writeDir("myCoolDir")

-- Create a new directory in our "files" directory
fs.writeDir("files/myCoolSecondDir")

-- Remove the entire files directory
fs.removeDir("files")
```

In the above example:

- `fs.readDir` returns a table (array) of strings with file and directory names
- `fs.writeDir` takes only the directory name (path) to create a directory
- `fs.removeDir` removes the directory **and everything inside it** - use with caution!

## Resulting File Tree

This is what our directory structure would look like after running the above examples:

<FileTree>

- files.luau
- dirs.luau
- hello-world.json
- myCoolDir/

</FileTree>

## What's Next?

Now that you know how to work with files and directories, let's learn about organizing your code with [Modules](./7-modules).
