Now we're getting to the really fun stuff! The `net` library lets your scripts talk to the internet - whether that's fetching data from websites, calling APIs, or even creating your own web servers.

## Making Web Requests

Let's start with something simple - fetching a web page:

```luau
// simple-request.luau
local net = require("@lune/net")

local response = net.request("https://www.example.com")

if response.ok then
	print(`Success! Got {#response.body} bytes`)
	print(`Status: {response.statusCode} {response.statusMessage}`)
else
	print(`Request failed: {response.statusCode}`)
end
```

When you make a request, you get back a response object with everything you need - the status code, headers, body content, and an `ok` field that tells you if things went well.

## Working with APIs

Most modern web services use APIs that speak JSON.
Here's how you can work with them:

```luau
// github-api.luau
local net = require("@lune/net")
local serde = require("@lune/serde")

-- Let's search GitHub for popular Luau projects
local response = net.request({
	url = "https://api.github.com/search/repositories",
	query = {
		q = "language:luau",
		sort = "stars",
		per_page = "3"
	}
})

if response.ok then
	local results = serde.decode("json", response.body)
	print(`Found {results.total_count} Luau repositories!\n`)

	for _, repo in results.items do
		print(`‚≠ê {repo.stargazers_count} - {repo.full_name}`)
		print(`   {repo.description}\n`)
	end
end
```

When you need to send data to an API, you'll typically use methods other than GET, such as POST or PATCH:

```luau
// posting-stuff.luau
local response = net.request({
	url = "https://api.example.com/data",
	method = "POST",
	headers = { ["Content-Type"] = "application/json" },
	body = serde.encode("json", {
		name = "My Lune Script",
		version = "1.0.0"
	})
})
```

The `serde` library handles all the JSON encoding and decoding for you, so you can work with regular Lua tables and other datatypes.

## Running a Web Server

Sometimes you don't want to make requests - you want to receive them. Creating a web server with Lune is surprisingly easy:

```luau
// my-server.luau
local net = require("@lune/net")

local visitCount = 0

net.serve(8080, function(request)
	visitCount += 1

	print(`[{request.method}] {request.path} - Visit #{visitCount}`)

	if request.path == "/" then
		return {
			status = 200,
			headers = { ["Content-Type"] = "text/html" },
			body = `<h1>Hello, visitor #{visitCount}!</h1>
			       <p>Try visiting <a href="/api">/api</a></p>`
		}
	elseif request.path == "/api" then
		return {
			status = 200,
			headers = { ["Content-Type"] = "text/plain" },
			body = `You are visitor number {visitCount}`
		}
	else
		return { status = 404, body = "Page not found" }
	end
end)

print("Server running at http://localhost:8080")
print("Press Ctrl+C to stop")
```

Your server can handle different routes, check request methods and headers, parse request bodies - everything you need for building real web applications.

## Beyond HTTP

The `net` library has even more tricks up its sleeve. It can handle WebSockets for real-time communication, raw TCP connections for custom protocols, and more.

### WebSockets

WebSockets are perfect when you need real-time, two-way communication.
Lune makes these very easy to use as well:

```luau
// websocket-client.luau
local net = require("@lune/net")

-- Connect to a WebSocket echo server
local socket = net.socket("wss://echo.websocket.org")

socket:send("Hello from Lune!")

-- Wait for the echo
local reply = socket:next()
print(`Server echoed: {reply}`)

socket:close()
```

<summary>Extra: WebSocket Echo Server</summary>

Here's a fun example that combines HTTP and WebSocket handling to create an interactive echo server:

```luau
// echo-server.luau
local net = require("@lune/net")

net.serve(8080, {
	handleRequest = function(request)
		return {
			status = 200,
			headers = { ["Content-Type"] = "text/html" },
			body = [[
				<h1>WebSocket Echo Test</h1>
				<input id="message" placeholder="Type a message">
				<button onclick="send()">Send</button>
				<div id="log"></div>
				<script>
					const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
					const log = document.getElementById('log');

					ws.onmessage = (e) => {
						log.innerHTML += `<p>Echo: ${e.data}</p>`;
					};

					function send() {
						const input = document.getElementById('message');
						ws.send(input.value);
						input.value = '';
					}
				</script>
			]]
		}
	end,
	handleWebSocket = function(socket)
		print("WebSocket connected!")

		for message in socket do
			print(`Received: {message}`)
			socket:send(`Echo: {message}`)
		end

		print("WebSocket disconnected")
	end
})

print("Echo server running at http://localhost:8080")
```

Try running this and opening http://localhost:8080 in your browser. You'll have a working chat interface!

<summary>Advanced: TCP Connections</summary>

For those times when you need to speak a protocol that isn't HTTP, you can use raw TCP connections, optionally backed by TLS:

```luau
// raw-tcp.luau
local net = require("@lune/net")

-- Connect to example.com on port 80 (HTTP)
local conn = net.tcp.connect("example.com", 80)

-- Send a raw HTTP request
conn:write("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n")
conn:write("Host: example.com\r\n")
conn:write("Connection: close\r\n")
conn:write("\r\n")

-- Read the response
local response = conn:read()
print("Response received:")
print(response)

-- Keep reading until the server closes the connection
while true do
	local chunk = conn:read()
	if chunk == nil or #chunk == 0 then
		break
	end
	print(chunk)
end

conn:close()
```

Here's how you can use TLS for secure connections - add a simple flag argument for enabling it:

```luau
-- Connect with TLS enabled
local secure = net.tcp.connect("example.com", 443, true)
```

This gives you the power to implement any TCP-based protocol - SMTP, FTP, custom game protocols, you name it. Lune does not currently provide built-in support for databases, but with TCP connections you can use existing clients built for other runtimes without much extra effort.

## What's Next?

With all this network power at your fingertips, you'll probably want to save some of that data you're fetching. Let's explore how to work with files and directories in [Working with Files](./6-working-with-files).
