Congratulations! Lune is now set up and you are ready to start writing scripts ðŸŽ‰

If you've already written some kind of Lua (or Luau) script before, the examples provided in the
overview below should make you feel right at home. They are organized in order of least complex to
most complex, and you don't really have to read them all to understand how Lune works, though it may
help you out. Good luck!
