title: Input & Output
---

Let's start exploring Lune's capabilities with the `stdio` library, which handles standard input and output. This is one of the most useful libraries for creating interactive scripts.

## Getting User Input

The `stdio` library makes it easy to interact with users. Let's create our first interactive script called `hello.luau`:

```luau
// hello.luau
local stdio = require("@lune/stdio")

local name = stdio.prompt("text", "What's your name?")

print(`Hello, {name}!`)
```

Save this file in your current directory, then run it using the Lune CLI:

```bash title="Terminal"
lune run hello
```

When you run this script, it will wait for you to type your name and press Enter, then greet you!

## Different Types of Prompts

The `stdio` library can prompt for more than just text. Let's expand our script to ask a yes/no question:

```luau
// hello.luau
local stdio = require("@lune/stdio")

local name = stdio.prompt("text", "What's your name?")
print(`Hello, {name}!`)

local confirmed = stdio.prompt("confirm", "Is that really your name?")
if confirmed then
	print(`Nice to meet you, {name}!`)
	print("Have a great day!")
else
	print("Hmm, well whoever you are, welcome!")
end
```

The `confirm` prompt type shows a yes/no question and returns `true` or `false` based on the user's choice.

These two prompt types - `text` and `confirm` - will cover most of your interactive script needs. There are more advanced options available in the [stdio API reference](../../api-reference/stdio) when you need them.

## Building a Simple Game

Here's a fun example that combines what we've learned with some basic Luau programming. Don't worry if you don't understand every line yet - focus on how `stdio.prompt` is used to create an interactive experience:

```luau
// guessing-game.luau
local stdio = require("@lune/stdio")

print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.")
print()

local answer = tostring(math.random(1, 10))
local attempts = 0

local guess = stdio.prompt("text", "What's your guess?")
attempts += 1

while guess ~= answer do
	if tonumber(guess) and tonumber(guess) < tonumber(answer) then
		print("Too low! Try again.")
	elseif tonumber(guess) and tonumber(guess) > tonumber(answer) then
		print("Too high! Try again.")
	else
		print("That's not a valid number.")
	end

	guess = stdio.prompt("text", "What's your guess?")
	attempts += 1
end

print()
print(`Correct! You got it in {attempts} attempts!`)
```

Try running this game and see if you can guess the number! This example shows how `stdio.prompt` can be used in a loop to create ongoing interaction.

```bash title="Terminal"
lune run guessing-game
```

## What's Next?

Now that you know how to get input from users, let's learn about handling input that comes from the command line when someone runs your script. This is covered in the next chapter on [Arguments](./4-arguments).
