The preferred way of installing Lune is using [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit),
a toolchain manager for Roblox projects. Rokit can manage your installed version of Lune and
other ecosystem tools, and allows you to easily upgrade to newer versions as they become available.

<Steps>

1. ### Installing Rokit

   Follow the installation instructions on the [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) page.

2. ### Installing Lune

   Navigate to your project directory using your terminal, and run the following command:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   rokit add lune
   ```

3. ### Upgrading Lune

   When a new version of Lune becomes available, using Rokit will also allow you to easily upgrade to it.
   Navigate to your project directory using your terminal again, and run the following command:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   rokit update lune
   ```

</Steps>

If you prefer to install Lune globally and having it be accessible on your entire system,
instead of only in a specific project, you can do this with Rokit as well. Just add the
`--global` option to the end of the commands above.

## Other Installation Options

<details>
<summary>Using GitHub Releases</summary>

You can download pre-built binaries for most systems directly from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/releases) page. <br /> There are many tools
that can install binaries directly from releases, and it is up to you to choose what tool to use
when installing here. Lune is compatible with both [Foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman)
and [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman).

# Install the package
scoop install lune
```

### Homebrew

```bash title="Terminal"
# Installs latest stable precompiled binary
brew install lune
```

**_or_**

```bash title="Terminal"

brew install lune --build-from-source
```

### APT

APT is a package manager for Debian-based Linux distributions that uses `dpkg` to install packages. <br/>
Follow the instructions at the unofficial [lune-packaging](https://github.com/CompeyDev/lune-packaging#apt) repository to install Lune using APT.

<Aside type="caution">
  The APT repository is hosted by the community and is not endorsed by or
  affiliated with Lune.

### AppImage

AppImages are platform independent sandboxed binaries that work out of the box. <br/>
Go to the [GitHub Actions Page](https://github.com/CompeyDev/lune-packaging/actions/workflows/appimage.yaml), and download the artifact suitable for your architecture from the build artifacts.

### AUR (Arch User Repository)

There are a number of packages available on the AUR:

- `lune` - Builds from the latest stable release source.
- `lune-git` - Builds from the latest commit in the repo; unstable.
- `lune-bin` - Installs a precompiled binary from GitHub Release artifacts.

These can be installed with your preferred AUR package manager as such:

```bash title="Terminal"
paru -S [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

**_or_**

```bash title="Terminal"
yay -S [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Only one of these AUR packages must be installed at a time in order to prevent
  conflicts.

### Nix

macOS\* and Linux users can use [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to install Lune.

<details>
<summary>Imperatively</summary>
<br />
**NixOS**

```bash title="Terminal"
nix-env -iA nixos.lune
```

**Non NixOS**

# If you are using flakes
nix profile install nixpkgs#lune
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Declaratively</summary>
<br />
**With [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)**

```nix title="Terminal"
home.packages = with pkgs; [
  lune

```nix title="Terminal"
enviroment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  lune

### Building from source

Building and installing from source requires the latest version of
[Rust & Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to be installed on
your system. <br /> Once installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo install lune --locked
```

### Binstall

[`cargo binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) provides a simple mechanism for installing rust binaries from crates.io, without
compiling from source unlike `cargo install`. Lune is packaged in a `binstall` compatible way.

With `binstall` installed and in your path, run:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo binstall lune
```
