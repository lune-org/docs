The preferred way of installing Lune is using [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit), a toolchain manager for Roblox projects. Rokit can manage your installed version of Lune and other ecosystem tools, and allows you to easily upgrade to newer versions as they become available.

<Steps>

1. ### Installing Rokit

   Follow the installation instructions on the [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) page.

2. ### Installing Lune

   Navigate to your project directory using your terminal, and run the following command:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   rokit add lune
   ```

3. ### Upgrading Lune

   When a new version of Lune becomes available, Rokit makes it easy to upgrade. Navigate to your project directory using your terminal again, and run the following command:

   ```bash title="Terminal"
   rokit update lune
   ```

</Steps>

If you prefer to install Lune globally and have it accessible on your entire system, instead of only in a specific project, you can do this with Rokit as well. Just add the `--global` option to the end of the commands above.

## Other Installation Options

<details>
<summary>Using GitHub Releases</summary>

You can download pre-built binaries for most systems directly from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lune-org/lune/releases) page. There are many tools that can install binaries directly from releases, and it's up to you to choose what tool to use. Lune is compatible with both [Foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman) and [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman).

### Scoop

Windows users can use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) to install Lune.

```sh filename="PowerShell"
# Add the bucket
scoop bucket add lune https://github.com/CompeyDev/lune-packaging.git

# Install the package
scoop install lune
```

### Homebrew

macOS and Linux users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install Lune.

```bash title="Terminal"
# Installs latest stable precompiled binary
brew install lune
```

**_or_**

```bash title="Terminal"
# Builds from latest stable source
brew install lune --build-from-source
```

### APT

APT is a package manager for Debian-based Linux distributions that uses `dpkg` to install packages. Follow the instructions at the unofficial [lune-packaging](https://github.com/CompeyDev/lune-packaging#apt) repository to install Lune using APT.

<Aside type="caution">
  The APT repository is hosted by the community and is not endorsed by or
  affiliated with Lune.

### AppImage

AppImages are platform-independent sandboxed binaries that work out of the box. Go to the [GitHub Actions Page](https://github.com/CompeyDev/lune-packaging/actions/workflows/appimage.yaml), and download the artifact suitable for your architecture from the build artifacts.

### AUR (Arch User Repository)

There are a number of packages available on the AUR:

- `lune` - Builds from the latest stable release source
- `lune-git` - Builds from the latest commit in the repository (unstable)
- `lune-bin` - Installs a precompiled binary from GitHub Release artifacts

These can be installed with your preferred AUR package manager:

```bash title="Terminal"
paru -S [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

**_or_**

```bash title="Terminal"
yay -S [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Only one of these AUR packages should be installed at a time to prevent
  conflicts.
</Aside>

### Nix

macOS\* and Linux users can use [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to install Lune.

<Aside type="caution">
  *the macOS build is currently broken. Help is wanted debugging [this
  issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/36f9963ac7ea0a471c1d408e90edec093a819d83/pkgs/development/interpreters/lune/default.nix).
</Aside>

<details>
<summary>Imperatively</summary>

**NixOS**

```bash title="Terminal"
nix-env -iA nixos.lune
```

**Non-NixOS**

```bash title="Terminal"
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.lune
# If you are using flakes
nix profile install nixpkgs#lune
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Declaratively</summary>

**With [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)**

```nix
home.packages = with pkgs; [
  lune
];
```

**System-wide NixOS configuration**

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  lune
];
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Temporarily</summary>

You can temporarily use Lune in your shell. This is useful to try out Lune before deciding to permanently install it.

```bash title="Terminal"
nix-shell -p lune
```

<summary>Using crates.io</summary>

### Building from source

Building and installing from source requires the latest version of [Rust & Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to be installed on your system. Once installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo install lune --locked
```

### Binstall

[`cargo binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) provides a simple mechanism for installing Rust binaries from crates.io without compiling from source (unlike `cargo install`). Lune is packaged in a `binstall`-compatible way.

With `binstall` installed and in your path, run:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo binstall lune
```
